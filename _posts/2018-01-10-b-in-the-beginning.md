## In the Beginning
In the beginning God created the **Null & Void**.
Now the earth was classless and of equal value.
So God moved over the **Void** and said "Let there be **Scarcity**"
and it was good.
From **Scarcity** God rent the world into **Assets** and **Liabilites**.
And God commanded **Time** to be created so that
the **Assets** accrued compound interest while **Liabilites** amassed debt.
Then God made the sea and land and plants and animals as resources to feed
**Production**.
And God said "Let us make **Consumers** to drive **Demand**." And it was so.
Then God said "Let us make **Capitalists** in our own image so that they may
rule over **Production** and **Supply** and subdue the **Law**."
Thus at the end of the beginning, **Order** solidified. All was good.
