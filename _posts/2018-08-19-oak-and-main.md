## Trite Overused Street Names
We in America suffer from unimaginative, but seemingly safe street names.
Names that don't offend.
Names that evoke familiarity no matter where you are, where you go.
A melting pot of homogeneous gray wordage.
Street names such as _Main_, _State_, _Elm_, _Oak_, _Lincoln_, ad nauseum.

## Some Suggested New Names with Focus
We need new street names that invigorate the mind by
forcing concentration and requiring articulate communication.
Names that can also aid machine navigators such as Google Maps.
Here, try these:
* _Left_ street
* _Right_ road
* _Straight Ahead_ avenue
* _Up_ lane
* _Back_ boulevard
* _Far_ court

## Directions
You say fella that you want to get to Acme Corporation?
Well, that's easy my long-eared friend.
You go down _Straight Ahead_ until you see Old Mrs. Winfred's house.
You'll know it by her mail box being painted with daisies and such.
Make a right on _Left_ and then an immediate left on _Right_.
For about, oh I say half a mile, keep on _Right_ until you see _Up_.
and make a right.
Drive on _Up_ to Joe's diner and make a left on _Back_.
Go on _Back_ for 3 blocks. Acme is on the left.
If you see the post office, you went to _Far_. Flip around.
Really can't miss it. Simple as apple pie.
