## Anthropocene
It has been proposed, although not officially adopted, that we now live in a
new epoch - the Anthropocene.
The word anthropocene is a combination of ancient Greek loosely translated into
"New Man", thus the New Age of Man.

I find the proposal somewhat arrogant, and again, Man-centric.

There is no doubt that humans have had significant impact on the
ecology, atmosphere, and, even geology of our planet. Indeed, we have entered
the 6<sup>th</sup> great mass extinction event as the result of human activity.

But for an epoch to be definitive, it must significantly differ from
the adjacent epochs, **and** have significant duration.
The Pleistocene (Ice Age), for example, lasted 2.5 million years

The proposed beginning of the Anthropocene Epoch has been anywhere from the
onset of agriculture 10kya to as recently as 1945,
the year identified as the start of the
Great Acceleration (to the Singularity?). The former is basically the 
Holocene, while the later, being less the 80 years long,
can only be interpreted as transitional.

So, perhaps the Anthropocene Epoch, in reality, should be relabeled the
Antrhopocene Event.
An event akin to the cataclysmic asteroid crushing the Cretaceous 66mya 
and enabling the Paleogene.
Or perhaps the event is better described by the Permian-Triassic
extinction 252mya, where the suffocating temperatures,
high levels of carbon dioxide and sulfer gases, and low levels of oxygen,
perhaps precipitated the Great Dying.

## Aintellicene
So if the Anthropocene is indeed an event rather than an age, what could be
next? Ah yes, the science of extrapolating the unfathomable future from the
overwhelming present and the lossy past.

However, being an optimist most days, here is my humble suggestion:
the **Aintellicene Epoch**. Let's derive it 
from the Latin "artificialis intelligentia" to make it more official.
Pronounced a.in.tel.li.cene. The New Artificial Intelligence era.

Two verions, depending on the moody weather:
1. _Triumphant Optimist_
The Aintellicene is the age of AI non-human constructs living and
fully integrated with AI enhanced humans.
A new golden age of amazing possibilities.
2. _Sorryfull Optimist_
Our AI legacy lives on but we do not.

Of course, on bad days, **Necrocene** seams the better identifier.
