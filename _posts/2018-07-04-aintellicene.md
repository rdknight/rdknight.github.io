## Anthropocene
It has been proposed, although not officially adopted, that we now live in a
new epoch - the Anthropocene.
The word anthropocene is a combination of ancient Greek subwords,
loosely translated into "New Man", thus the New Age of Man.

I find the proposal somewhat arrogant and discontinuous.

There is no doubt that humans have had significant impact on the
ecology, atmosphere, and, even geology of our planet. Indeed, we are
witnessing the 6<sup>th</sup> great mass extinction,
mostly as the result of human activity.

But for an epoch to be definitive, it must significantly differ from
the adjacent epochs, **and** have significant duration.
The Pleistocene (Ice Age), for example, lasted 2.5 million years

The suggested beginning of the Anthropocene Epoch has been anywhere from the
onset of agriculture 10kya to as recently as 1945 CE,
the year identified as the start of the
Great Acceleration of humanity (to the Singularity and beyond?).
The former is basically the Holocene, while the later,
being less the 80 years long, can only be interpreted as a transitional 
series of events.

So, perhaps the Anthropocene Epoch, in reality, should be relabeled the
Anthropocene Event (AE) that defines the boundary between two epochs.
An event akin to the cataclysmic asteroid crushing the Cretaceous 66mya 
and enabling the Paleogene.
Or perhaps the AE is better described by the Permian-Triassic
extinction 252mya, where maybe the suffocating temperatures,
high levels of carbon dioxide and sulfer gases, and low levels of oxygen,
all colluded in the Great Dying.

## Aintellicene
So if the Anthropocene is indeed an event defining a boundary, rather than
a span of geological time, what epoch could the AE presage?
Ah yes, the science of extrapolating the unfathomable future from the
overwhelming present and the lossy past. No error bars allowed.

However, being an optimist most days, here is my humble prediction and
suggested name: the **Aintellicene Epoch**.
Let's derive it from the Latin "artificialis intelligentia" to make it more
official.
Pronounced a.in.tel.li.cene. The New Artificial Intelligence era.

Two versions I foresee, depending on the moody weather:
1. _Triumphant Optimist_:
The Aintellicene is the age of AI non-human constructs living and
fully integrated with AI enhanced humans.
A new golden age of amazing possibilities.
2. _Sorryfull Optimist_:
Our AI legacy lives on magnificiently, but we do not.

## Alternative Universe
Of course, on my bad days, **Necrocene** seems the better moniker.
