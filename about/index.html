<p>Yes, it <b><u>is</u></b> all about me.</p>

<h2>A Short Career Bio</h2>
<p>A Bakersfield, California boy.</p>

<p>I've worked on farms and packing sheds in the summer.
For 5 years I fought forest and grassland fires in the southern mountains.
I was a gas jockey a few times, enjoying the inhalation of lead.
Tried my hand on oil production rigs on the coast.
Installed automotive components at Sears.
Operated mainframe computers during the swing/graveyard shifts.
</p>

<p>After mostly finishing school (Bakersfield Jr. College,
CSU Bakersfield), I worked for Occidental Petroleum writing code to simulate
2 and 3 phase fluid flow.
After grad school (UC Santa Barbara), I was hired by Bell Labs in Colorado.
Essentially I was sucked into the burgeoning telecom business,
my math degrees became a despressingly foggy past.
From AT&amp;T, I jumped to Qualcomm, and then got
devoured by Ericsson.
</p>

<p>Then, in 2002, I co-created a synthetic black hole by co-founding
RoadNarrows LLC. The dream was to create intelligent robots and software
and live a decent life. We were idea rich but cash poor.
More cash crossed the event horizon. And then more...
</p>

<p>Today a downsized RoadNarrows sells third party robots and related hardware,
along with first tier technical support. Through RoadNarrows contacts,
I still get an occasional software gig.
</p>

<p>I research AI on my own.
In some minor way, I hope to contribute to the AI community that benefits
people.</p>

<p>Always looking for work.</p>

<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Anybody tells you that it is
&quot;<em>nothing personal, just business</em>&quot;
is either a liar or a sociopath.
</p>

<p>I have two daughters. They are both grown, have their own lives, are
succesful, happy, and healthy.
As a father, I vividly remember holding them when they were very young
and, as they grew, watching them discover the world about them.
I experience the odd emotion that I suspect many parents must feel.
The entangled emotion of loss of the &quot;<em>yesteryear</em>&quot;
and the contentment of the &quot;<em>in the now</em>&quot;
</p>

<p>I am married to a brilliant and kind wife, the other co-creator of a
synthetic black hole. Thanks?</P>

<p>I love the West. The cultures from Baja California Sur to British Columbia
to New Mexico to Montana are really more similar than Missouri is to Oregon
or Alabama is to Massachusetts.
I mountain bike, stand up paddle, run, hike, lift, cross-country ski,
yada, yada, yada. I'm no expert at any. It doesn't matter.
Maybe someday, I'll learn to surf.
Yeah, I love the West.

<h2>Mantra</h2>
<p>a;lskdfjl;ej<br>
<em>(anger typing at my unresponsive computer)</em>
</p>

<h2>Inspirations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The observable universe has a radius of 45 billion light
    years. Fraq me.</li>
  <li>People can be emotionally brilliant when not being stupid and cruel.</li>
  <li>Dragonflies have been around 325 million years, essentially unchanged.
    Evolution, one hell of a search engine.</li>
  <li>I am unique - just like everybody else.</li>
  <li>Change is probably the most fundamental property of the universe.
    It is the <strong>forcing function</strong> to nudge all of us out of
    our local gluteus maxima.
  </li>
  <li>&hellip;</li>
  <li>Is this list a countable set?</li>
</ul>
