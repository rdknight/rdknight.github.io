<h2>A Short Career Bio</h2>
<p>A Bakersfield, California boy.</p>

<p>I've worked on farms and packing sheds in the summer.
For 5 years I fought forest and grassland fires in the southern mountains.
I was a gas jockey a few times, enjoying the lead filling my lungs.
Tried my hand on oil production rigs on the coast.
Installed automotive components at Sears.
Operated mainframe computers during the swing/graveyard shifts.
</p>

<p>After finishing school (Bakersfield Jr. College,
CSU Bakersfield, UC Santa Barbara), I was hired by Bell Labs in Colorado.
Essentially I was sucked into the burgeoning telecom business,
my math degrees became a despressingly foggy past.
From AT&amp;T, I jump to Qualcomm, and then got
devoured by Ericsson.
</p>

<p>Then, in 2002, I co-created a synthetic black hole by founding
RoadNarrows LLC. The dream was to create intelligent robots and software
and live a decent life. We were idea rich but cash poor.
And more cashed poor, ...
</p>

<p>Today RoadNarrows simply sales third party robots and related hardware,
along with first tier technical support. Through RN contacts, I still get
an occasional SW gig.
</p>

<p>Today, I research AI on my own. Always looking for work.</p>
